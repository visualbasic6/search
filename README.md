# google cli search engine client (coded w/ chatgpt ai)
a cli google client that bypasses captcha and rate limiting by using the google alert's "preview" feature. this script was written with non-code input by chatgpt ai. it didn't find the captcha/rate limiting bypass - but it did code a functioning implementation of it.

**how to use (ubuntu)**
```
snap install go --classic
apt install git
git clone https://github.com/visualbasic6/search.git
cd search
go run google.go
```
